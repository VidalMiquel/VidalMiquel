### [My Personal Project](https://github.com/VidalMiquel/Final-Thesis-Project)
This work explores the hypothesis of whether complex networks are a suitable tool for defining the behavior of a football team. To this end, we have defined an approach based on the passes made before a goal, considering each goal scored as a score difference to analyze. This process is based on an initial phase of data collection, processing, and filtering, followed by a second phase of statistical and topological analysis.
